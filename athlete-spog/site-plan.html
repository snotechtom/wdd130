      <p>
        There are a number of wearables that have been born in the past couple years: Apple Watches, Samsung Watches, FitBits, WHOOP Straps, Garmins, etc.  These are great and provide lots of information but how do you correlate this data?   What if you want to track it with some of your own data (how you felt, goals met, Personal Records from various sports: Running, Weight Lifting, CrossFit, Skiing, Biking, and even Pickle Ball)?  How about diet and sleep, how is this impacting your performance?
        <br>
This is where athletes from professionals to those lacing the tennis shoes for the first time can find a Single Pane of Glass (SPOG) can combine all of their data in one place.  The Athlete SPOG will take data from any wearable and manually uploaded stats and open up data correlation, trends, graphics, or just journaling the adventure.
<br>
Athlete SPOG will not lock you down to any specific ecosystem.  If you want to wear a Garmin on your runs but pull sleep data from an Apple Watch, we got you.  If you want to see how your Fran time in CrossFit, combined with your biking performance on your Hammerhead Karoo, we can combine it.  If you do not have a Fitbit Aria, smart scale, and want to enter in your weight from your old school scale, no problem.

      </ul>
      <h3>Data Inputs</h3>
      <p>
        Athlete SPOG allows for uploads from any system that either allows for export of data files or opens to syncing between multiple platforms.  Currently, customers have successfully synced:
        <br>•	Apple Health
•	Garmin Connect
•	FitBit
•	WHOOP
•	Strava
•	Beyond the Whiteboard
•	SugarWOD
•	Training Peaks
•	SUUNTO
•	POLAR
•	MyFitnessPal
•	Hammerhead
•	Zwift
•	Wahoo
•	Ithlete
•	Elemnt
<br>
Though the ease of connecting already existing data from other Apps and wearables is powerful, Athlete SPOG isn’t limited to only these systems.  Athlete SPOG allows you to create your own statistics, whether it is tangible like a bench press weight for X number of reps or it is intangible like how sore you feel the next morning on a scale 1-10.

      </ul>
      <h3>Data Correlation</h3>
      <p>
        Many just like to have a place where they can see or even show off their results.  If that is what you are hoping to accomplish with Athlete SPOG, then you are good to go.  But there is more out there that you can take advantage of Athlete SPOG.
<br>
With the data residing in one place with your batting average from the past three softball seasons, you can see how your diet, sleeping habits, and your swimming times impact you’re your better work softball games.  We have powerful servers and customization that allows you to select which attributes from various inputs into the system, be correlated across specific time domains and displayed in savable graphical dashboards.
<br>
Coaches can also be granted access to this data and use it to hone in on key performance indicators.  With the journaling feature that looks similar to social media threads, you can communicate with your coach or other members of your team.  If you want to keep your Pickle Ball obsession under wraps, then lock down those inputs as private.
<br>
Go on a run with a friend in which you ran at their pace and now worried about that impacting your averages.  Also, no problem!  You can insert your own custom variable in all of your runs.  Indicate which are leisure and which are top performance.  Track your 5K results separate from your Long Slow Distance runs.  You can even drill into specific intervals within a run and remove your easy jogs between hard 400m sprints to show only the averages between those grueling runs.
<br>
Have two swim meets that you are confused at why best efforts created drastically different results, have the system calculate a specific time period before each meet.  The system will show indicated efforts that could have contributed to one having a better performance.  Perhaps it was consistent 8 hours of sleep before the faster time.  Maybe it was the casual runs with friends during a month stretch.
