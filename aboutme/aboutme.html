      <p>  I am looking forward to getting to know you all throughout the coming semester.
      I live in Loveland, CO with my wife and five children (ranging from 7-14 years old). I am studying Computer Information Technology.  When I am not working, we like to spend our time in the mountains either hiking or skiing, depending on the season.  I also enjoy throwin weights around in a CrossFit box or running in the local 5Ks.</p>
      <p>Currently, I work for a large financial bank within security governance (specifically PCI).  I figured after 15 years of working in IT,
        I should get the degree to go with the experience.  Although I have spent a lot of time working on networks and firewalls that permit websites through, it will be fun to focus on something other than layers 1-4 of the OSI model.</p>
